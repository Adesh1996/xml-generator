Slide 2: Introduction - What is this Utility?
Purpose: A robust tool designed to rapidly generate large volumes of ISO 20022 XML messages.

Problem Solved: Automates the creation of diverse test data for financial systems, reducing manual effort and potential errors.

Key Use Cases:

Testing payment processing systems.

Simulating high-volume transaction scenarios.

Generating sample data for development and demonstrations.

Target Audience: Financial institutions, software developers, QA engineers, compliance teams.

Slide 3: Key Features
Template-Based Generation:

Uses any valid ISO 20022 XML file (e.g., PAIN.001, PAIN.007, PAIN.008, PACS.008) as a customizable template.

Flexible Configuration:

User specifies the total number of transactions.

User defines the number of batches to organize transactions.

User can generate multiple copies of the final XML file.

Dynamic Data Population:

Automatically updates critical fields:

MsgId (Message ID)

CreDtTm (Creation Date/Time)

ReqdExctnDt (Requested Execution Date - if present in template)

Transaction IDs (EndToEndId, InstrId, TxId)

NbOfTxs (Number of Transactions) and CtrlSum (Control Sum) at both Group Header and Batch levels (if present).

Filename Convention: The generated filename dynamically includes a code (SDSC, SDMC, MDMC, MSDSC) indicating the transaction and batch structure (Single Document Single Credit, Single Document Multiple Credit, Multiple Document Multiple Credit, Multiple Single Document Single Credit).

In-Memory Processing:

Generated XML files are never persistently stored on the server's disk.

Enhances security and reduces resource footprint.

Consolidated Output:

All generated XML files are automatically compressed into a single ZIP archive for convenient download.

Web-Based User Interface:

Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction and file generation.

Slide 4: Impact & Statistics
Time Savings:

90% Reduction in test data preparation time compared to manual creation.

Generate a complex test suite in minutes, not hours or days.

Volume Capability:

Capable of generating 10,000+ transactions per minute, adaptable to system resources.

Supports the creation of hundreds of distinct XML files in a single run.

Accuracy & Reliability:

Near-zero manual error rate due to automated field population and structured generation.

Ensures consistent data formatting critical for compliance and system integration testing.

Resource Efficiency:

Minimizes server storage requirements with purely in-memory generation and direct download.

Slide 5: Benefits
Increased Efficiency: Automates a time-consuming manual process, freeing up resources.

Improved Accuracy & Consistency: Ensures generated data adheres to the template's structure and ISO 20022 standards.

Enhanced Flexibility: Supports various message types and allows for diverse test scenarios.

Data Security: In-memory generation minimizes the risk of sensitive data exposure on the server.

Scalability: Multithreaded processing allows for the rapid generation of large file volumes.

Cost Reduction: Lowers operational costs associated with manual data creation and management.

Slide 6: How It Works (Technical Overview)
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):

Provides a simple form for users to upload a template and input parameters.

Handles form submission and displays loading indicators.

Backend (Java/NanoHTTPD):

Request Handling: Receives the uploaded template and parameters.

XML Parsing: Uses javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder to parse the input XML template.

Document Cloning: Deep clones the XML Document for each required copy to ensure independent modification.

Dynamic Updates: Iterates through the cloned XML structure, identifying and updating elements like IDs, dates, and sums based on the configured logic.

In-Memory Transformation: Converts the modified XML Document objects directly into byte[] arrays using javax.xml.transform.Transformer and ByteArrayOutputStream.

ZIP Archiving: Compresses all generated XML byte[] arrays into a single ByteArrayOutputStream as a ZIP file.

HTTP Response: Streams the in-memory ZIP content directly back to the client for download.

Slide 7: Usage Guide (Quick Start)
Start the Application:

Navigate to the project root directory.

Execute build_and_run.bat (Windows).

Access the User Interface:

Your default web browser will automatically open to the application's index.html page.

Upload Your Template:

Select your desired ISO 20022 XML template file (e.g., SMSRFT_PAIN1V3.xml, pacs8V2.xml).

Configure Generation Parameters:

Enter the "Total No. of Transactions" you need.

Specify the "Total No. of Batches" to divide transactions into.

Indicate the "No. of Copies of Generated File" you require.

Generate & Download:

Click the "Generate File" button.

The application will process the request, and a ZIP file containing your generated XMLs will be downloaded.

Filename Convention: Each generated XML file will be named according to its format, a timestamp, and a type code (e.g., PAIN1V3_SDMC_20250721123456789_F1.xml). The type code (SDSC, SDMC, MDMC, MSDSC) indicates the transaction and batch structure.

Slide 8: Future Enhancements (Roadmap)
Expanded Message Type Support: Implement specific logic for additional ISO 20022 message types (e.g., CAMT.053, other PAIN/PACS versions).

Advanced Configuration UI: Provide a more granular UI to specify which fields should be randomized, incremented, or replaced with specific values.

Schema Validation: Integrate XSD validation to ensure generated XML files are strictly compliant with their respective schemas.

Performance Optimizations: Further fine-tune multithreading and XML processing for even higher throughput.

Reporting: Generate summary reports of the generated files (e.g., total transactions, sums).
